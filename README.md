## Code Standards

The following code standards are applicable to all projects:

### Code Quality

1. **Function Design**
   - Functions should do only one thing and do it well
   - Keep functions small (ideally less than 20 lines)
   - Functions should have a single level of abstraction

2. **Variable Naming**
   - Use names that reveal intent
   - Use pronounceable names
   - Use searchable names
   - Avoid encodings

3. **Class Design**
   - Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
   - Encapsulate related data and behavior
   - Maintain high cohesion

4. **Conditional Logic**
   - Use descriptive variables to explain complex conditions
   - Extract complex conditions into well-named functions or variables
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants
   - Group related conditions to express business logic
   - Avoid deep nesting of conditionals
   - Consider using early returns to simplify logic

### Common Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. **God Objects/Classes**
2. **Magic Numbers/Strings**
3. **Deep Nesting**
4. **Complex Inline Conditions**

## Quality Assurance

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Write integration tests for critical paths
- Use appropriate testing frameworks (pytest for Python, Jest for TypeScript, Pest for PHP)
- Implement E2E tests for critical user journeys

### Documentation

- Keep README files updated
- Document setup and installation procedures
- Include API documentation for public interfaces
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Document configuration options
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Include examples for common use cases
- Document significant changes
- Maintain a CHANGELOG
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Infrastructure & Security

### Security Best Practices

- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize all user inputs (trim, escape, validate)
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Regular security dependency updates
- Implement rate limiting where appropriate
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement proper CORS policies: Don't use '*'

### Performance

- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching strategies
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Optimize assets (images, scripts, styles)
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Consider scalability in design decisions

### Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alternative text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain proper color contrast
- Support screen readers
- Implement ARIA labels when necessary
- Test with accessibility tools
- Support text resizing
- Provide focus indicators

### Reliability

- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging and monitoring
- Use circuit breakers for external services
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Monitor system health
- Have fallback mechanisms
- Implement proper validation
- Use feature flags for risky changes

### Maintainability

- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep code modular and loosely coupled
- Use dependency injection
- Maintain consistent coding style
- Keep dependencies updated
- Remove unused code and dependencies
- Write self-documenting code
- Use appropriate abstraction layers
- Maintain proper folder structure
- Regular code refactoring
